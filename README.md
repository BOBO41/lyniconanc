Lynicon CMS for ASP.Net Core (.Net Standard 1.6, .Net 4.6)

In tune with the .Net Core philosophy, Lynicon is a composable and unopinionated CMS which is lightweight and low impact yet full featured.  Modules to provide functionality needed for larger sites, such as caching, url management, search, and sitemap generation will be provided as a paid-for module package, currently slated for release by the end of March this year.

This CMS project provides the essential CMS functionality for the Lynicon in ASP.Net Core, perfectly adequate for a smaller site or application.  There is an MVC 5 version [here](https://github.com/jamesej/lynicon).  The project site is [here](http://www.lynicon.com), and this project builds a NuGet package whose page on Nuget is [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LyniconANC).  Documentation on Confluence is [here](https://lynicon.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOC/ASP.Net+Core+Version).  We welcome feedback to info@lynicon.com, and you can sign up for news and the Slack support channel on [this page](http://www.lynicon.com/get-lynicon).
