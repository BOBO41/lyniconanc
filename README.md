# lynicon CMS for ASP.Net Core

Lynicon is a modern, highly flexible, hypermodular CMS built on the ASP.Net Core web framework.

The main site for the project is http://www.lynicon.com, and Lynicon is documented in detail at https://lynicon.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOC/Lynicon+CMS+Documentation.  (there is no independent ASP.Net Core documentation as yet we are working on this and it should be available within a month)

Lynicon is issued under the Fair Source 10 license, it is open source and free up to a maximum of 10 users in any one organisation: https://fair.io/#license

To run the tests in this project you will need to install the NUnit 3 Test Adaptor extension for Visual Studio.
